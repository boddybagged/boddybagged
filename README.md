Hi, this is a journal about my journey in python i guess.
not really sure how to use github at all but i suppose its a something like twitter for programmers lol
been a pretty turbulent journey with python, many a times unable to find motivation to open up the course materials and study, opting to waste time on youtube and games instead.
lets restart and properly learn the language.
as of writing this, im on the topic of if and while loops.
